  "post_id": 456,
  "ai_job_id": "ai_9f3a",
  "redirect": "/deals/123"
}


Server behavior

Requires verified physician

Writes Post(post_type="deal") + DealDetails

If auto_ai=true, enqueue AiJob(job_type="analyze_deal", deal_id=123)

Return ai_job_id for immediate polling in UI

Wizard metadata (optional but helpful)

GET /api/deals/meta

Returns lists for asset_class/strategy options + group list for the user

2) Weekly “Signal Digest” job (retention engine)
Output spec (the digest card)

Top 3 deals (by “signal score”)

Top 3 comments (by “impact score”)

“AI: what we learned this week” (short)

CTA: “Review these 3 deals” → deep links

Ranking formulas (simple, robust)

Deal signal score

10 * deal_endorsements

+ 2 * comment_count

+ 0.1 * author_reputation_score

Recency decay: multiply by exp(-age_days / 7)

Comment impact score

5 * comment_endorsements

+ 0.1 * commenter_reputation_score

If comment is on a deal: +2 bonus

Recency decay: exp(-age_days / 7)

Job schedule

Weekly: Monday 07:00 America/St_Thomas (or 08:00)

Storage

Digest(id, period_start, period_end, created_at)

DigestItem(digest_id, item_type, entity_id, score, rank)

One Notification per user referencing the digest

Endpoint

GET /api/digests/latest

GET /api/digests/<digest_id>

Minimum implementation

Cron/scheduler runs a Python function:

fetch last 7 days data

compute scores

write digest + items

notify verified users (in-app)

3) Invite-only growth mechanics (keep quality high)
Rules (v1)

Only verified physicians can invite

Each verified physician gets 2 invites

Invites expire in 14 days

Invitees can sign up but remain read-only until verified

Data model

Invite

code (random, unique)

inviter_user_id

invitee_email (optional)

status: issued|accepted|expired|revoked

created_at, expires_at, accepted_at

Endpoints

POST /api/invites (create)

admin can create unlimited; normal users limited to remaining credits

GET /api/invites (my invites)

POST /api/invites/accept (accept with code)

returns signup token / associates invite to new account

UX

“Invite colleagues” page with:

remaining invites

copy link button

list of issued invites + status

4) Reputation weighting + sorting (anti-noise)
Don’t show “likes” as the main signal

Keep “likes” for lightweight feedback, but sort by endorsements + reputation.

Sorting rules

Default comment sort on deals

Pinned (admin/mod pinned)

“Best” = comment_score

“New” optional tab

Comment score formula

10 * endorsements

+ log1p(commenter_reputation_score) * 3

+ 2 if commenter is verified physician (redundant but useful)

- 10 if comment is flagged > threshold

Recency small decay only after 14 days

Feed sort (deals tab)

“Trending” = deal signal score (above)

“New” = created_at desc

“Following” = only from followed users/groups

Guardrails

Daily endorsement cap per user (e.g., 25/day)

No self-endorsement

Downrank accounts with repeated reports

5) Activation playbook for onboarding first doctors (the script + process)
Goal

Within 7 days:

50 verified doctors

20 deal posts

150 meaningful comments

70% of users return at least once

Cohort selection

Start with 25–50:

10 attendings (credible anchors)

10 “curious learners” (post questions)

5–10 finance-savvy docs (high-signal responders)

2 moderators (you + one trusted doc)

Onboarding steps (Day 0–2)

Personal invite (short, direct)

“Doctor-only room. Verified only. Deals + diligence. No noise.”

Verification concierge

You process approvals 2x/day for the first week

First action

Wizard forces: “post 1 deal OR post 1 question”

Content seeding (Day 1–7)

You pre-seed:

3 example deals (anonymized)

3 “how would you diligence this?” posts

1 “what I wish I knew before investing” thread

You post a weekly prompt:

“Post a deal you passed on and why.”

Engagement loop

When someone posts a deal:

You tag 3 credible people (manually at first)

AI analyst runs automatically

You comment first with a model “diligence checklist”

Create one weekly live “Deal Rounds” thread (async)

Success metrics to watch daily

% verified within 24h of signup

Time-to-first-post (goal < 48h)

Deal posts per verified user

Comment depth per deal

Endorsements per user (too high = gaming)
