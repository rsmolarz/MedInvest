Here’s the unambiguous next step if you want this to turn into a real product with momentum, not just a well-built system.

You’ve now cleared the three hardest early blockers:

Trust gating (verification pipeline)

Asynchronous intelligence (AI analyst with persistence)

Admin throughput + UI

From here, the risk is overbuilding. The leverage is activation + retention.

NEXT #1 — Activation Loop (this is the highest leverage now)

Goal: A verified doctor posts one deal and gets value within 24 hours.

Build (small, surgical)

First-Deal Wizard

4 steps max:

Asset class

Thesis (plain text)

What I want feedback on

Visibility (physicians / group)

Auto-run AI Analyst on submit

Auto-prompt the room

When a deal is posted:

Tag 3–5 relevant specialties or asset-interest cohorts

Send notifications (“New deal needs eyes”)

Why this matters
Doctors don’t explore products.
They need a clear first action with fast feedback.

NEXT #2 — Weekly “Signal Digest” (retention engine)

Build

Scheduled job (weekly):

Top 3 deals by endorsements

Top 3 comments by reputation delta

One AI-generated “what we learned this week”

Deliver

In-app notification first

Email later (don’t block on email infra)

Why
This creates:

Social proof

Fear of missing signal

Habit without doom-scrolling

NEXT #3 — Reputation-weighted sorting (anti-noise)

Change

Default sort on comments:

reputation_score * endorsement_weight

Hide raw like counts from non-authors

Why
This prevents LinkedIn-style engagement decay and protects signal quality.

NEXT #4 — Invite-only growth (defensive moat)

Mechanism

Verified doctors get 2 invites

Invites unlock:

ability to comment

ability to post deals

Why

Keeps quality high

Creates social accountability

Controls moderation load

NEXT #5 — Legal & Trust Hardening (before scale)

You don’t need lawyers yet—but you need clear rails.

Add

Mandatory disclaimer on deal creation

“Educational discussion only” flag per deal

Soft compliance language (not investment advice)

This protects the platform and users.
